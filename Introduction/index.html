  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a fun and easygoing person who really enjoys having real, face-to-face conversations with the people closest to me. I love deep talks with my family and friends, whether about the Gospel or everyday stories.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also love traveling, sipping coffee with a nice view, playing guitar, singing, drawing, and I’m currently learning how to dance. Music keeps me inspired.
